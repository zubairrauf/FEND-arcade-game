## The concept
"Cross the road" is a clone of the classic arcade game "Frogger".  Your mission is to cross the road safely without getting hit by the traffic.

## Instructions
The game starts with 4 vehicles one the road.  Use the arrow keys to move your player left, right, up and down. There is a safe area between the two raods. You can also stop at any lane as long as there is no vehicle driving there. 

## Levels
The game starts at level 1. At each new level, there is a new vehicle added to the traffic untill it reaches 8 vehicles. After that, the speed of the vehicles gets increased for each new level. 

## Lives
You have three lives. You lose a life each time you get hit by a vehicle. When you lose all three lives, the game is over.
